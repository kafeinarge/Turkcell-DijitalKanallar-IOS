Explanations

1- Each object must know own responsibilities. Their abilities are certain.
2- We use protocols to define the responsibilities of all classes in terms of the determination of tasks.
3- We use the delegates is to allow an object to communicate from the owner independently in a separate way.
4- MVVM is a good preference for this project according to the project's scale. I used the presentations. All view controllers do not know models. They communicate just presentations. View controllers behave like a presenter.
5- Dependency Injection is one of my favorite preferences. It provides perfect convenience to progress a  project. Also, it provides to get easier maintenance and implementing new objects.
6- I used core data to store and to do offline mode favorite movies in this project.
